Features

Real-Time Object Detection: Detects objects in real-time using a camera feed with a TensorFlow Lite model (detect.tflite).
Image Classification: Supports two MobileNet variants for image classification (float and quantized models).
Text Sentiment Analysis: Analyzes text sentiment using a lightweight TensorFlow Lite model.
Privacy-Focused: All ML inference runs locally on the device, ensuring data privacy.
Optimized Performance: Achieves >30 FPS with model quantization, isolates, and adaptive resolution.
Cross-Platform: Compatible with both iOS and Android via Flutter.

Technologies Used

Framework: Flutter/Dart
Machine Learning: TensorFlow Lite
Architecture: Clean Architecture + Bloc Pattern
Dependency Injection: GetIt
State Management: Flutter Bloc
Key Dependencies:
tflite_flutter: ^0.10.0
camera: ^0.10.0
flutter_bloc: ^8.0.0
get_it: ^7.0.0
See pubspec.yaml for the full list.



Architecture
The application follows Clean Architecture with three main layers:

Presentation Layer: Manages UI (Widgets, Pages) and state (Bloc/Cubit).
Domain Layer: Contains business logic (Use Cases, Entities, Repository Interfaces).
Data Layer: Handles data sources (Local/Remote) and repositories.

Key components:

Object Detection: Uses a TensorFlow Lite model (detect.tflite) with a 300x300 input size and a 0.5 confidence threshold.
Image Processing Pipeline: Captures images, converts YUV420 to RGB, preprocesses (resize, normalize), performs inference, and applies post-processing (NMS).
Isolates: Runs ML inference in a separate isolate to maintain UI responsiveness.

Installation
Prerequisites

Flutter SDK (version >=3.0.0)
Dart (version compatible with Flutter)
Android Studio/Xcode for emulator or device testing
Git

Steps

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Application-Mobile-d-Intelligence-Artificielle.git
cd your-repo-name


Install Dependencies:
flutter pub get


Add Assets:Ensure the following assets are placed in the assets/ directory:
assets/
├── detect.tflite                      # Object detection model (5.1 MB)
├── labelmap.txt                       # 80 COCO classes
├── mobilenet_v1_1.0_224.tflite       # Float classification model (16.9 MB)
├── mobilenet_v1_1.0_224_quant.tflite # Quantized classification model (4.3 MB)
├── text_classification.tflite         # Sentiment analysis model (0.6 MB)
├── text_classification_vocab.txt      # Vocabulary (0.1 MB)
├── labels.txt                         # 1001 ImageNet classes

Update pubspec.yaml to include these assets:
flutter:
  assets:
    - assets/detect.tflite
    - assets/labelmap.txt
    - assets/mobilenet_v1_1.0_224.tflite
    - assets/mobilenet_v1_1.0_224_quant.tflite
    - assets/text_classification.tflite
    - assets/text_classification_vocab.txt
    - assets/labels.txt


Run the App:
flutter run



Notes

Ensure a compatible device/emulator with camera support is connected.
For Android, rotate images by 90 degrees if needed (handled in IsolateUtils).
Models must be compatible with TensorFlow Lite (quantized for better performance).

Usage

Launch the App: Open the app on your iOS or Android device.
Camera View: The main screen displays a live camera feed with real-time object detection.
Bounding Boxes: Detected objects are highlighted with bounding boxes and labels (e.g., "dog 0.85").
Image Classification: Upload or capture an image for classification using MobileNet.
Text Sentiment Analysis: Input text to analyze sentiment (positive/negative probabilities).
Performance Metrics: View inference time, FPS, and other stats in the UI.

Example usage:

Point the camera at an object to see real-time detection.
Use the draggable sheet to toggle between detection, classification, and sentiment analysis modes.
